## Setup
1. Clone the Hyperloop repository (use SSH)
    * [Generate SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
    * [Add new SSH key to your account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

2. Clone the repository, switch to the UI branch, pull any recent changes, and navigate to GUI folder
    ```
    git clone <ssh>
    git checkout UI
    git pull
    cd GUI
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment
    `python -m venv <environment_name>`
    * Example: `python -m venv gui_env`

4. Activate the virtual environment
    * MacOS/Linux: `source <environment_name>/bin/activate`
        * Example: `source gui_env/bin/activate`
    * Windows: `<environment_name>\Scripts\activate`
        * Example: `gui_env\Scripts\activate`

5. Install the required dependencies: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. Run the GUI: `python main.py`

7. Deactivate the virtual environment (when finished working): `deactivate`

## Github
1. Initially, switch to a new branch: `git checkout -b <new-branch>`
2. Make all the changes
3. Check the files you have changes: `git status`
4. Add files: `git add <filename>`
5. Commit files: `git commit -m <message>`
6. Push changes: `git push`
   - On the first push, it will complain. Copy the command it suggests using.
7. After you have pushed all changes, create the pull request
   - You want to merge the feature branch (the branch you created) into the UI branch

## Widget Choices & Reasoning
1. Window : MainWindow
2. Sensor tabs: QTabWidget
- Fits nicely accordingly to the Figma design
- Alternative QStackWidget did not work because it does not allow multiple widgets appear on the same stack, thus not able to layout widgets as shown in the design
3. Window Layout : QSplitter
- QSplitter splits the main window into different sections and allows layout embedding within the sections
- Alternative QLayout does not allow embedding of the sensor tabs
4. Plotting Graph : PlotWidget
- Embedded in the layouts of sensor tabs (on the left)
- Currently displaying data from dummy arrays
- But, can extract sample data from a txt file of the same file directory instead by replacing `second` and `temperature` with `xs` and `ys`

## Sensor Research
Accelerometer: 
* measures acceleration
* Time vs. acceleration

TOF range finder: 
* Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are used for a range of applications, including robot navigation, vehicle monitoring, people counting, and object detection
* Time vs. distance 

Ultrasonic range finder: 
* measure the distance between the sensor and its object using ultrasonic frequency
* Time vs. distance

Thermistors: 
* measure temperature
* Time vs. temperature

Inductive proximity sensor: 
* detects metal targets using electromagnetic energy and without contact
* Time vs. distance 

Infrared proximity sensor: 
* measure reflected infrared (IR) energy to detect the presence of an object or person
* Time vs. distance
